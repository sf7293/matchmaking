# Assumptions
I've considered that:
- A session is where players, ranging from 2 to 10, can compete against each other.
- A player can participate in only one session at a time until it concludes.
- To join a new session, players must leave their current contest.
- A session's contest begins at a specified timestamp (if there are at least two players) and ends after a designated duration from the start time.
